# Memory-Profiler

# Installation

```
$ pip install -U memory_profiler
```

# Usage
## line-by-line memory usage
The line-by-line memory usage mode is used much in the same way of the line_profiler: first decorate the function you would like to profile with **@profile** and then run the script with a special script (in this case with specific arguments to the Python interpreter).

# Execution 

```

$ python -m memory_profiler example.py

```
